# v0.4.0 Tasks 4 & 5 - Complete ✓

## Task 4: Register Code Review Skills in participant.ts ✅

### Status: Already Complete
The code review skills were already properly integrated in participant.ts:

**Imports (lines 15-16):**
```typescript
import { codeReviewRequestSkill } from './skills/code-review-request';
import { codeReviewReceiveSkill } from './skills/code-review-receive';
```

**Registrations (lines 35-36):**
```typescript
this.registry.register(codeReviewRequestSkill);
this.registry.register(codeReviewReceiveSkill);
```

**Build Verification:**
```
> superpower-copilot@0.4.0 compile
> node esbuild.js
Build complete ✓
```

## Task 5: Update Integration Test ✅

### Changes Made to `test/integration/participant.test.ts`

**Test Name Updated:**
- From: `'All 7 slash commands should be available'`
- To: `'All 9 slash commands should be available'`

**Command Count Check:**
- From: `assert.strictEqual(commandNames.length, 7)`
- To: `assert.strictEqual(commandNames.length, 9)`

**New Assertions Added:**
```typescript
assert.ok(commandNames.includes('review'));
assert.ok(commandNames.includes('respond'));
```

### Verification Results

**Manual Test Simulation:**
```
